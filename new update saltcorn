=========================================================================



Certainly! To install Saltcorn on Ubuntu, you have a couple of options. Let's walk through them:

1. **Quick Automated Install (Recommended):**
   - This method is straightforward and works on Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04, and 21.04.
   - Open your terminal and run the following three commands (as root or with sudo access):
     ```bash
     wget -qO - https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo bash -
     sudo apt-get install -qqy nodejs npx
     saltcorn-install -y
     ```
   - The first two lines install Node.js 18, and the last line installs Saltcorn along with PostgreSQL. It sets up Saltcorn as a service listening on port 80. If you want to customize the installation (e.g., use a different port or database backend), omit the `-y` flag for an interactive installationÂ¹.

2. **Manual Installation:**
   - These instructions are for Ubuntu 20.04 (but should work on other versions too).
   - First, install Node.js and other dependencies:
     ```bash
     wget -qO - https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
     sudo apt-get install -y nodejs libpq-dev build-essential python-is-python3
     ```
   - Next, create a user for Saltcorn:
     ```bash
     adduser saltcorn
     adduser saltcorn sudo
     su saltcorn
     cd
     mkdir -p ~/.config/
     npm config set prefix /home/saltcorn/.local
     echo 'export PATH=/home/saltcorn/.local/bin:$PATH' >> /home/saltcorn/.bashrc
     source /home/saltcorn/.bashrc
     ```
   - Install Saltcorn:
     ```bash
     npm install -g @saltcorn/cli
     ```
   - If the installation fails, try this command instead:
     ```bash
     npm install -g @saltcorn/cli --unsafe
     ```
   - Set up Saltcorn:
     ```bash
     saltcorn setup
     ```
     Follow the instructions, and when prompted, enter the sudo password you set for the saltcorn user.
   - Exit the saltcorn user and become root again:
     ```bash
     exit
     ```
   - Run Saltcorn manually as the saltcorn user:
     ```bash
     sudo -u saltcorn saltcorn serve
     ```
     Check that you can connect to your server through your domain. If not, verify your DNS setup.
   - To install Saltcorn as a service (so it runs in the background and restarts automatically after reboots), create a service file:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/saltcorn.service
     ```
     Add the following content:
     ```
     [Unit]
     Description=saltcorn
     Documentation=https://saltcorn.com
     After=network.target

     [Service]
     Type=notify
     WatchdogSec=5
     User=saltcorn
     WorkingDirectory=/home/saltcorn
     ExecStart=/home/saltcorn/.local/bin/saltcorn serve -p 80
     Restart=always
     Environment="NODE_ENV=production"

     [Install]
     WantedBy=multi-user.target
     ```
     Make sure the node executable can open port 80 for non-root users:
     ```bash
     sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' `which node`
     ```
     Finally, reload systemd and start the service:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl daemon-reload
     sudo systemctl start saltcorn
     ```
     You're all set! Saltcorn will now run as a serviceÂ¹.
